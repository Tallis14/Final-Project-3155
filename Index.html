<h1> &emsp; Introduction</h1>
    <p> &emsp; The idea for this project is to help people understand how much student loan debt is owed. This is important for the members of the group </p>
    <p> &emsp;  as we are college students and owe student loan debt so it was a topic that was near and dear to us. The idea is that by looking at the </p>
    <p>  &emsp; data in a visual way we can gather a better understanding of how much money our generation owes in student loans compared to other </p>
    <p>  &emsp; generations. Another piece of motivation to do this project is that student loan debts are really hard to be forgiven so we want to </p>
    <p>  &emsp; understand how in debt people are because of student loans. Knowing other things to allow how not to take student loans would be useful</p>
    <p> &emsp;  to society and we will be focusing on that. The showing of generations of student loan debt and projected amount of time to pay them off </p>
    <p>  &emsp; will be for encouraging other methods of paying for college as we believe that for society it is better to not have as much debt.</p>
