Tristan Allison: The source is https://data.worldbank.org/ and the data set is the data of world poverty
Ryan Dukats: The source is https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh and is a data set on metorite landings.
Johnny Xiong:
Orane Richards: The source is https://www.statista.com/statistics/256245/total-self-inflicted-deaths-of-active-military-personnel-in-the-unites-states/. It describes the total US military suicides per year between 1990 to 2010.

Identify who your customer/s would  be (8 total points)

Tristan Allison: The customer would be the united nations.
Ryan Dukats: The customers would be astronomers and scientists
Johnny Xiong:

Tristan Allison: The major features would be taking the data provided and splitting it into the location within the country and use that to know where to target to improve the quality of life.
Ryan Dukats:The major features of the proposed project would be taking the data and sorting by geolocation and projecting a heat map of the most common landing locations and their size
Johnny Xiong:
Orane Richards: A few major features of my project would be chat rooms for veterans to reach eachother all over the world and discuss their issues, as well as an option to check in as often as wanted (daily, weekly, monthly)  with a peer or medical professional to ensure the user is staying safe.
